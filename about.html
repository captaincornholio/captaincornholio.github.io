<p> I am Captain Cornholio, but you may know me in real life by another name. I am a 22-year-old computer engineer attending the University of Pittsburgh. I was born in Nashville, TN, lived for twelve years in central PA, and attended high school in a Pittsburgh suburb. </p>

<p> I will write about any topic, but some of my interests include ultimate frisbee, NASCAR, computing technology, graphics design, guitar, music charts, travelling, college visits, college football, sports betting, sports in general, internet memes, and Pok√©mon (video games and trading card game). </p>
