So I have been kind of busy this past week catching up on projects and such after a series of frisbee tournaments. I quickly realized I could not maintain a pace of one post a day since my life is obviously not that interesting as you can tell. I will try to post sporadically but more than likely, I will write a whole bunch whenever I have a chunk of time and then split them up over the following week or so. I originally did not have anything planned for today but I finished both the assignments I had for today early (maybe I can blog about my coding assignments, any interest?). That, and I realized today is a day that I hold near and dear to my heart, so I figured I would talk about that.

### April 9, 2014

Flashback to my senior year of high school one more time (I really do enjoy living in the past), and let us go through a normal morning for me. Class starts at 7:22 so I try to be in the classroom by 7:20 so I try to be parked by 7:14 so I try to be at the stop sign by 7:10 so I try to leave my house by 7:00 so I try to wake up by 6:30. The day began like any other when I woke up at 6:40 and then showered, ate my eggs, drank my milk, and rushed out the door. It was late senior spring, but my first period teacher was very strict and I did not want to get on his bad side.

I sped round the bends and over the hills and turned right onto Old 22, making good time. I pass the stop sign at 7:08. Nice, I am making very good time. Then the flow of traffic stops. I guess some people are having some trouble parking... 7:12 and I have not moved. Now I was getting pissed. I was going to be late because peopel do not know how to drive. That is when I noticed people were getting turned around at the top of the hill leading up to the school. What the hell... I guess all the cop sirens should have tipped me off.

I eventually get to the top of the hill and get told to turn around. I ignore her and hurriedly park my car in the substitute lot and rush towards the school. My sister gets dropped off about the time I leave the house so I knew she was already there. I figured it was something more significant than some idiot pulling the fire alarm.

I started text bombing people asking where she was and it was another hour before I found out she was safe. Turns out when the fire alarm went off, she left her phone in the library. Come on. Really? Like no disrespect, but in an emergency, grab your phone to let people know you are safe, to communicate with others and find out if they are safe, so mum and dad know you are alright, come on...

So I was making my way towards the football field where everyone seemed to be gathering. Many were still unsure about what had happened and I started thinking school shooter situation. Why would I want to go on a wide open field? I turn around to go back to my car only to find the whole perimeter taped off so I could not leave. Oh well, I call my mum to let her know what was going on. She has no idea.

We get corralled into the middle school gymnasium and I find some friends and we begin speculating as news slowly trickle in. School shooter. Two people. One person. One dead. Thirty plus injured. No one dead. Four people critical. Officer down. Forty-five injured. Stabbing. No gun. Two knives. Twenty-five injured. Threatening phone calls. Name of the stabber. Bullied. Not bullied. Unsourced information was coming in from every direction and becoming overwhelming.

At some point, we realized no one died and everyone we were friends with were accounted for and started joking around a little. There were no TVs in the gym but I was sure we were getting national attention. Mass stabbings are not that common and I am sure all those networks wanted to put their own political twists on it. I wanted none of that, but certain people with clear messiah complexes were quick to jump on the opportunity and make a name for themselves.

I originally wanted to keep this all to one post, but it got pretty long pretty quick. I guess a follow up is needed and will come soon. I will conclude the day by saying those of us in the gym were eventually picked up by our parents. Those with cars were allowed to drop by and pick them up later that afternoon.

To be continued...
