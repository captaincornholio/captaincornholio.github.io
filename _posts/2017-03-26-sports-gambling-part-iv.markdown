Yeah, it was pretty bad.

# The Journey

I will be brutally honest in that I am not sure how I pulled off making a profit in gambling. All the odds are against me. Bovada has notoriously unfair lines. I have no knowledge of sports other than NASCAR (which was in its offseason) and maybe college football (and you all can see how those results turned out. I was biased towards teams that I or a friend had a personal interest in. I do not remember much from the bets I made earlier on since Bovada only keeps a log of bets place within the past fourteen days. However, I exported my [list of bets](http://pastebin.com/R8PdkeD1) from the last two weeks of my gambling career (which lasted sixteen days).

I will summarize what the list says about my betting ability. The Famous Idaho Potato Bowl took place on December 22nd, 2016 and the list starts recording on December 24th so we only missed two days of betting so I would guess I am still hovering around $25 to $30 (including the Bovada bonus). I cringe at some of my earlier bets. I was putting whole dollars (these are significant when they are X percent of your entire bankroll) on games where I was just straight up guessing. Sure, the Dallas Cowboys at -270 was a good choice, but Ravens @ Steelers Under 36.5 on Christmas Day? I do not know what I was thinking. That Ravens @ Steelers game also exhibited chasing. At the fourth quarter, the two teams went over 36.5. Proficient gamblers would know to step away at this point, instead I did a live bet of a fourth quarter Over 17.5 to recoup my losses. It was a very ballsy move and it worked out in the end, but if it had not, it would have only served to tilt me further and possibly made me make another bet on a random line of Turkish basketball.

At this point, I started looking into soccer and lost a bunch of money. Then I started randomly betting on college football bowl games of teams I had not watched during regular season and lost more money. After a reckless wager on Pitt vs Northwestern Over 65 of $5 which lost after a pathetic showing from both offenses, I was down to less than $10. At this point, I was ready to give up and admit I had my ass handed to me by Vegas.

### Reddit Saves the Day

After losing more money to Rutgers basketball and Texas A&M football, I was desperate. I hated losing. I hated losing actual money no matter how trivial the amount. I thought to myself that there must be knowledge from gamblers out there who know what they are doing so I turned to Reddit and discovered [/r/sportsbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook). I started blindly tailing people which is another big no-no in betting, but I was going for broke. I bet on a UFC fight at -150 and won. I bet on a soccer game at +135 and won (which I then lost and more on another soccer game and two underdog bowl picks).

At this point, I should have realized I should stop betting on bowl games, then I remembered my original goal of gambling, to bet a lot on heavy favorites. I had wasted my bankroll on essentially 50/50 picks where I do not have an edge due to my lack of knowledge. It was the Peach Bowl that reminded me of this. Alabama was not going to loss to Washington. There was no chance. I put my entire bankroll of $13 on Alabama (-550)... and made $2.37. I was rolling again. I went back to tailing Reddit picks and hit a lucky streak of 5-1. At this point, I was comfortably back up to $20. Then the Cotton Bowl came up. As much as I love what Western Michigan did, they were not beating Wisconsin. I put $15.23 (no idea why) on Wisconsin (-320) and won $4.76. I was back up to $25 where I started now with newfound knowledge.

The new year rolls around and I put $21 on Canada to win a hockey game (duh) to win $1.32. Again, I will reiterate that even though $21 is nothing in the long run, it is so stressful sitting here just wondering what will happen. I wanted to be done as soon as I can. I discovered tennis where upsets were rather rare, specifically in elite men (I learned to stay away from women's and doubles). Rafael Nadal (-550)? I took it. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (-240)? I took it. Also, never fade the Williams sisters. They made me a few bucks.

### Hockey

Hockey could have ruined my life. I knew nothing about hockey but I would place bets on obnoxious outcomes not happening. Under 8.5 (-900)? Sure. Under 7.5 (-2000)? Sure. Under 4.5 (-450)? My career could have ended right there. At some point, I realized that teams pull their goalies if they are behind in the third period. So if a score going into the third is 3-2, I would hammer the Over 5.5 (in regulation of course) if it was offered. This was the one bet I never lost out on, but for one game, I had $12 on the line to win $1 and it did not hit the over until the last sixteen seconds. That was stress.

### Quit While You're Ahead

I went back to soccer and started another stupid strategy. Soccer is unique in that moneylines have three options since soccer games can draw. I would bet on two outcomes and would make a smaller profit if either one occurred (and lose double if the third outcome occurred). For example, in the Arouca vs Varzim game, I put $1.25 on Arocua (-125) and $0.70 on Draw (+230). If Arocua won, I would make $0.30. If the game was a draw, I would make $0.36. Not big stuff, but again I was chipping away at my goal of $50 and very rarely did the third outcome happen since I chose the two more likely options. Hey, it ain't stupid if it works.

I continued slowly advancing by betting on tennis favorites, hockey third period overs, and double soccer lines. On January 5th, I bet $8 on Agnieszka Radwanska (-700) and she lost. That was the biggest hit I took in gambling career in one bet. I was insanely lucky. Later that day, I put $33.50 on Novak Djokovic (-6600) for $0.51. That is not responsible gambling. Neither is live betting on tennis where you cannot even see the match to see what condition the players are in. Somehow, I came out with $7.23 thanks to Andy Murray and successfully chased (gamblers everywhere are cringing) my lost $8.

Profits continued to slowly roll in from live betting tennis matches. On January 6th, I was invited to a house party and had quite a lot to drink while keeping Bovada up on my phone. I put $25 on Lauren Davis (-2500) to win $1. I later learned Lauren is still a college student at UVA. I have no problem gambling on college team sports, but gambling on college individuals just seems wrong. Anyway, I was almost there. I have no idea who Christopher O'Connell is, but he won me $4.67. I was betting solely based on lines at this point. $40 on Kei Nishikori for $2.40. I was so close. I was sitting at $49. I needed something I was familiar with.

I had no idea the Arizona Coyotes was a hockey team, but apparently they were trailing the Anaheim Ducks in the third period, 1-2. I did what I learned a few days ago, I hit the Over 3.5 (-1000). This team I had never heard of scored. I won the bet. I was over fifty dollars. I requested my check and never spent another dime on the site. I was worried that the check would never show up or if it did, it would bounce. It arrived two to four weeks later in a nice DHL envelope and did not bounce. The journey was over. No more stressful nights refreshing Brazilian soccer scores. I had beaten Vegas.

# A Frisbee Conclusion

So in my examples of betting terms, I created a theoretical game of ultimate frisbee between Pittsburgh-B and Franciscan that may have occurred today. Well, it did happen. Would you believe me if I said it was a 15-9 Franciscan victory? My picks of Franciscan (-6) and Under 24 both pushed since I guessed both exactly right. I must be wizard.
