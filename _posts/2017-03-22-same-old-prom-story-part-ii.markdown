# NASCAR Philosophies

Who would have thought that I could relate NASCAR to my personal prom story, but it must be done. My senior year of high school was fall 2013 going into spring 2014. In July 2013, it was announced that Ryan Newman would not be returning in 2014 to his #39 team which had been his home for five years. One of the quotes he made early on (I cannot seem to find the exact quote unfortunately) said that he only wants to be with a team that wants him. Occasionally in NASCAR, teams hire veterans on short term contracts to keep the seat warm for younger drivers they have in their development programs who they will promote in a year or two and replace the veteran driver.

This idea struck a chord with me. When I got waitlisted by Case Western, I turned down being put back into the applicant pool. Why would I want to go somewhere that did not want me? I started to feel the same about dating. Why would I want to date someone who does not want me? Likewise, why should I pressure someone to date me who does not want me? Perhaps this is the wrong approach. I do not know much of anything about dating, but I think I would rather be alone than with someone who does not want me.

So let us backtrack to March 2014, Ryan Newman had just finished his first races with his new #31 team and I was wondering where I should rent my tux for prom. I figured I would ask anyone who showed any interest. I was not too worried because girls in our friends group outnumbered guys and a lot of the guys were dating girls outside the group. Here is the thing. People who pair up for prom either are dating, are almost dating, or have been talking for awhile. Very rarely do we see matchups out of nowhere. Sure, they do happen sometimes, the same way Chris Buescher lucked his way into winning a race this past summer. Even then, Buescher had to be in the right place at the same time and have some semblance of competitiveness despite the lack of quality of his team. He could not simply show up without a car and a plan and win a race. To sum it up, I did not want to ask someone out of the blue.

It was not that I feared rejection (which is a legitimate fear), but rather harkening back to the Newman quote in that if I asked someone randomly, she would probably say yes, but neither one of us would enjoy it much beyond some fake outward appearance for pictures (some people claim that is the point since memories fade and pictures are forever, but you could make the argument the other way). I poked around to see if there was any interest and was discouraged by the lack thereof. A sophomore girl I was friends with at the time half-heartedly offered to go with me. I turned her down on the premise that she is a sophomore and it would have been weird since my group is entirely seniors and because I was not into her at all (at the time). I was later told the only reason she asked was because the guy she was into in her grade was going with an older upperclassman girl and she wanted to one-up him. I do not know how true this is. Knowing either way would not really benefit me and I highly doubt she will ever read this and clarify.

Going on a related tangent, at the time, there was another girl that a couple friends and I may have been crushing on. It might have been a crush or an obsession or just a game; we are still not sure. Our behavior would confuse psychologists for years to come if they ever witnessed what was happening, but that is a story for another time. The main point here is that this may have also played a factor in distancing me from prom. On the positive side, there was a prom afterparty at a friend's house that is now infamously known as **#Camping2014**, but that is another story for another time.
