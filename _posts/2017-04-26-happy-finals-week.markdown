One thing I do like about Pitt is how early the semester ends. All of us are done before May unlike other schools that go up until Memorial Day. I would surely sacrifice some winter vacation for a longer summer. Granted, I have not had a true summer since high school, but just the warmer mood and stuff. In any case, this stupid song has been stuck in my head the whole week and along with some other bizarre circumstances have made this a strange week.

I might touch upon that later, but prepare for an onslaught of depressing, angsty, and introspective posts in the coming weeks. :)
