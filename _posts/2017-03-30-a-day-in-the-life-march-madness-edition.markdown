I got some busy weeks ahead of me so my posting will slow down and posts will likely be shorter if I continue to do them semi-regularly. Otherwise, they will be longer and more spread out, but I had to share this short story.

So Panther Central, one of Pitt's official Twitter accounts, ran a March Madness contest that gave you a chance to win a 16GB iPod Nano.

Despite having 4,000 followers, not a single person entered the contest after the first two days and I mentioned that in passing to a few people in one of the engineering study rooms. This was my mistake. I was too much of a coward to put my image up alone and had to get someone else to do it with me. It made sense at the time. Actually no, it did not even make sense at the time.

Either way, a kid named Don and I were the only ones who entered. If you search the hashtags on Twitter, you can probably find us and our entries. Anyway, so we put up our entries and forget about it. I checked a few days later and we were still the only two entries on Twitter. I wondered why. Did people just not care enough to win an iPod Nano even though all it takes was to post a selfie? Did people learn to tune out the Panther Central account because it usually posts irrelevant nonsense? Was this contest intended for me as a consolation prize for other things that have gone wrong in my life (yes, I understand privelege and my life is a very significant net positive)? I did not even want the iPod since I already have an iPod Classic that does its job just fine. I just figured I could resell it for around the $149 it is currently retailing. That could have paid for the Ryan Newman diecast and the new Pok√©mon card booster box, but alas it was not meant to be.

As I was walking home from a Microsoft seminar held in the same fateful room I told others about the contest, I received a Facebook message and this is what I saw.

Now I was first surprised they announced the winner so early since the tournament had not even ended yet. Then I realized, I had lost. I had lost because I was a wuss. I need to own up to my findings and be more selfish next time. I did not tell others because I wanted to give them a chance to win. I told them because I was too scared to do it by myself and the joke ended up being on me. You can say what goes around comes around and this makes up for all the 50/50 bets that fell my way during my gambling stint, but I would much rather have an easy $150 than a stressful $50 (technically only $30 profit).

I wonder what could have been if I did not tell others about the contest. I figure it would have been quite a story, how I had won $150 by virtue of being the only entry in a random drawing. On that note, I wonder how the event organizers felt about having only two entries for their contest which they promoted pretty hard. They tweeted their contest multiple times a day while I was hoping they would stop to limit visibility, but it did not make a difference for it was just our two entries for the entire duration of the contest. I guess losing a contest with a grand total of two entries also makes a good story... Actually, no it does not.

Oh well, the next time I stumble upon a contest with no entries, I will know what to do and you will too.
