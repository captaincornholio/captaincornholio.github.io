I guess today is significant in that it is the last day of classes of my junior year. Sure, I have a recitation tomorrow and finals next week, but wow...

### The 10A

The 10A is a campus shuttle that goes on a loop from the Cathedral through North Oakland through Upper Campus and back down the hill. When I was a freshman, I would frequently ride the 10A from my classes on lower campus back up to my dorms on upper campus. Nowadays, I sometimes ride it to get back to my place in North O, but usually I walk just because it is nice out again.

### A Short Interaction

So I was chilling in the last session of COE 0449. There was no lecture and the professsor was just fielding questions. Most people had already ditched or were goofing off on their laptops. I was working on the coding project when I got a Snapchat from a friend. She sent a picture of her studying in front of Hillman. Yo, that was just a block away. I should go say hi. So I pack up my stuff, say bye to the kid next to me, and peace out from 0449 forever (until the final next Wednesday).

I exit the building (why is it called a building if it is already built?) and the skies open up and let go. Her Snapchat five minutes ago was literally a sunny day. What the hell. Whatever, I Snapchat back something along the lines "lol I was gonna come say hi" and start walking home. I noticed a 10A pulled up in front of Cathy. Perfect timing. I walk onto the bus and notice there were no available seats. Oh well, standing is cool. She Snapchats back and tells me to come to the Taco Bell in the Union (William Pitt Union if you are following along geographically). I could have easily walked off the bus and crossed the street to the Union; the 10A usually chills in front of Cathy for a few minutes before leaving, but I did not. I reply I was already on the bus and that was that.

### A Question of Closeness

In a classic case of procrastination when I got home, my mind began wandering. She invited me to chill and I could have easily gone but I chose not to. Why not? If it was not pouring, I probably would have exited and gone to find her. If it was not pouring, she probably would have still been in the same spot she sent the original Snap from, but that is beyond the point. Had the 10A not been there and I was walking home in the rain, I probably would have gone and chilled in the Union until the skies cleared at least. 

What if it was a different person? Surely, if someone I was crushing on invited me to Taco Bell, I would have been off that bus in an instant. Or a friend I had not seen in awhile. Or a frisbee teammate. Or a friend from high school. Or a friend in general? Where would I draw the line? Is it a question of how close I am to someone that determines whether or not I would have gotten off the bus? I am still closer to many high school friends than to college friends, but out of the latter, she is pretty high up there. Perhaps, it is becuase I see her rather frequently so I felt less inclined to say hi. Again, if I were romantically interested and whether we already talked frequently or we were not close at all, judgment goes out the window and I would have sprinted out the bus into the Union.

I started thinking of people I would have gotten off the bus for and for the most part, many, many people made the list. Am I pushover? Possibly, but it is not like I had much to do when I got home since I did not have any studying planned for today. In retrospect, I feel kind of bad because she is one of the few people here who actually takes time to talk to me and pretty much the only person who texts first / randomly just to chat, and yet I would not get off the bus for her.

What about the other way around? Who would get off the bus for me? Would anyone? There have been so many instances where people I was talking to were minutes away and I asked them to drop by and they never did. Sure, they might have been busy, but I think of all the times I have hopped off the bus for people compared to the times they have for me. It surely sweetens the good memories of a good friend dropping by at night and having a conversation under the porchlight for an hour or the time two friends showed up with no warning and took me to the movies, but those are far and few between. I guess getting off the bus is a metaphor for going out of your way to catch up or hang out with someone. I know I would for a lot of people, but I realize most of those would not do the same for me. Perhaps I simply am a pushover.

### Ending on a High Note

I always like ending these things on a high note. So a legend at Pitt is that if you get hit by a 10A, you will get free tuition for a year. I do not think it has happened recently, if ever, but we would always joke about jumping in front of the 10A to get the cash. A similar legend is that if your roommate in on-campus housing died, you will get all As for that semester. This led to slightly more morbid jokes of making your roommate disappear. Luckily for me, my freshman and sophomore year roommate did not kill me nor jump in front of a 10A. He is a good dude. I would totally jump off the bus for him.
