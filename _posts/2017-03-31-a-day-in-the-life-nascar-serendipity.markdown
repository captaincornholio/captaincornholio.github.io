So I ran out of toothpaste earlier this week. I also lost my comb at some point so it was time to take the long trek out to Target to pick up some nice necessities. After an uneventful day of Friday recitations in which I only had three awkward moments, I wandered home where my car was parked up the road. Usually it stays at my home home, but I needed it two consecutive weekends for frisbee tournaments so my mum told me to just risk it and leave it on the street despite not having a street pass. Luckily, I got away with it this week.

Anyway, so at Target, I pick up my toothpaste and comb and wander around to see if there were any rare NASCAR diecast. There were not so I wandered over to the card section to see if there were any new Pokémon box sets. It had been announced that a full art Jolteon box and new Umbreon and Espeon promo boxes were being released later this year so I wanted to save money for those. I wandered further down the aisle and noticed the NASCAR cards. I knew they existed but I had never seen them in person. I did not really expect them to find them in Pittsburgh to be quite honest.

Sorry, Jekyll does not seem to have the ability to natively resize photos, but here is the box. Notice how it says one autograph or memorabilia card per box *on average*. That probably means I will choose the one box that does not have one. Oh well, I will test my luck especially after losing on the 50/50 coin flip yesterday. What is the worst that could happen? I shifted the first one on the shelf aside and picked up the second one on the shelf as I always do. Superstition.

I make my way back home and bust it open. It has been almost a decade since the last time I bought NASCAR cards so it was quite exhilirating. The cards themselves were surprisingly high quality. The first four packs were pretty uneventful. I was slightly annoyed because there were no Ryan Newman cards while I got bunches of Jimmies and Kurts and Kyles. I was beginning to wonder if I actually did get a dud box as I popped open the fifth pack and noticed that one card was considerably thicker than the others. This was it. I wonder who and what it was. I slowly turn it over and find...

Of all the drivers I could have gotten (or not have gotten at all), I got an ultra rare Ryan Newman card. I got actual rubber from tires that were used during a race. It smelled kind of bad. I was so hype, more hype than any Pokémon card I have opened in recent memory (since the full art Misty). What were the odds... all the things that had to happen for me to end up with this card. Whatever the case, I am not complaining. I will take what I can get.

I open the last pack and pulled an individually numbered common card shown below. The card to the left is a standard card and the card on the right features gold foil and the stamped number. This got me thinking...

![Interesting...](\assets\img\landon_cassill_card.jpg)

If every card has 500 gold foil parallel cards and my box only had one of those in six packs and there are 200 cards in the base set alone, does that mean over 600,000 packs of NASCAR cards have been printed? Who even buys these? Sports card collecting fell of the radar years ago and even many NASCAR fans do not know that these were produced, much less the general population who probably would not buy any if they did know.

I looked on eBay for listings of individual cards and card lots and found them to be incredibly low in number and value. I wonder where all the cards and boxes went. Is some rich NASCAR collector hoarding them all? Is some crazy Landon Cassill fan trying to collect all 500 gold foil cards? Maybe the numbers are all made up and there are actually only 100 of each? Or maybe they are much more common than I think and there should be at least one in every pack and I got unlucky? Then again, I cannot complain about being unlucky. On my desk sits my ultra rare Ryan Newman card.
