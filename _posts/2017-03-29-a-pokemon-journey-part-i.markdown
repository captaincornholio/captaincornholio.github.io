So I shall continue introducing myself through a series of posts and hopefully people will find them intriguing even as standalone stories. It is these little things and short (or long) journeys that help make a person who they are.

### The Non-Existent Beginnings

Why Pokémon? This is something eight-year-olds play and grow out of a year or two later. So what made me get into it at such a late age. To answer this, we must go back to the beginning. I was raised in an academically-focused household and thus did not have much access to media of any sort for much of my childhood. Sure, there was NASCAR, but they had the TNT summer contract back then so I could not even watch races during the only season I was allowed to watch non-educational TV. Streaming was not an option. Even if it was, I was only permitted to be on the computer for an hour a day (for non-educational stuff) so I could not watch full races.

So all throughout elementary school, I heard and occasionally caught glimpses of all these things that classmates were talking about, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokémon, Beyblades, Kelly Clarkson, etc. but I truly had no idea what they were. I did not care too much either, for my parents have told me they are all a waste of money and will distract me from my schoolwork. I did not question it. I do not blame my parents for this and in the end, everything turned out alright for the most part. I guess to sum it up, my childhood consisted mostly of school, soccer (which at best, I was mediocre at), and an occasional glimpse at NASCAR in the newspaper.

### Catching Up

A theme that comes up every so often in my life is the feeling that I missed out on something that could have been beneficial or enlightening or simply fun and I try to catch up by doing it years later. My prom story is a major example and I am sure more will pop up as I continue writing. In any case, Pokémon is one of those cultural phenomena that never quite goes away due to game releases every couple of years, the annual movies, and a new set of trading cards every few months. It was inevitable that at some point, I would be exposed to it enough that I would give it a go.

Some time during my junior year in high school, I was convinced to play a Pokémon game using a GameBoy emulator on my HTC Evo™ 4G LTE exclusively on the Sprint network™. It was a Generation II game, though unfortunately, I can not remember the specific version. I know I played it frequently during band and being frustrated by Whitney's Miltank to the point I quit right after I beat it because I did not want to go through the rest of the gym leaders if they all were that annoying. I later learned that was not the case, but thus ended my first foray into Pokémon. Do not fret for it only gets better.
