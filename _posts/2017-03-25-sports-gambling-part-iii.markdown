This is probably more than you ever wanted to know about sports gambling, but is this not captivating? There are so many more topics to cover.

# Props

Props, short for propositional bets, are pretty silly and I try to avoid them when actual money is on the line. Usually they are things like how many rushing yards will player X get or will the home or away team win the coin flip? Bringing back our previous frisbee game, here are some examples of some props for the game.

> Which team will score first?
> 
> Franciscan (-150)
> 
> Pittsburgh-B (+120)
> 
> 
> How many turnovers will there be on the first point?
> 
> 0 (-115)
> 1 (+110)
> 
> 2 or more (+150)
> 
> 
> What will the jersey number be of the player who scores the first point?
> 
> Odd (-110)
> 
> Even (-110)
> 

# Futures

Future bets are long-term bets for bigger events in the future such as which team might win a championship. They are pretty much a scam due to the unpredictable nature of sports?

> What team will win the 2017 Ultimate College National Championship?
> 
> Pittsburgh (+180)
> 
> UNC (+220)
> 
> Colorado (+250)
> 
> Minnesota (+350)
> 
> Oregon (+400)
> 

# Parlays

Parlays are also a scam in which the gambler has the option to link a number of wagers together for a massive payout if they all come true. If one wager or "leg" loses, the entire parlay is lost. I am not sure how it was derived, but there is an equation out there that shows the parlays are mathematically less successful than straight bets in the long run.

# Shifting Lines

This goes back to spreads and lines. Remember, the bookies want half the action on either side of the spread. It is not half for the moneyline, but it is the same idea. Let's go to our original example of Franciscan (-6) and Pittsburgh-B (+6). The hypothetical news came out today that one of Franciscan's starters got injured and would not be able to play. The gamblers rush to the books and start hammering Pittsburgh-B (+6).

The bookies respond to this by shifting the line to Franciscan (-4) and Pittsburgh (+4). The gamblers who made bets with the +6/-6 spread keep that bet, but anyone who makes a bet from the moment the bookie changed the line has to make a decision on the +4/-4 line.

# Fading

Fading simply means to bet against a person or team. I have no idea where this term originates, but apparently it was originally called "coppering" and then like all trendy phrases, it evolved. Whenever a team does poorly, a gambler might proclaim, "Fade Penn State!" Likewise if a person who publically posts their gambling picks online and is on a losing streak, people may suggest others to "fade him". Lastly, in frustration after losing a bunch of bets and running out of money, I might slump down against the wall and mutter, "Fade me."

Now, you all have no excuse to not understand me when I make gambling references. One final word of advice, if you ever get caught in a situation where I am going off about bets I would place theoretically or in reality, fade me hard.
