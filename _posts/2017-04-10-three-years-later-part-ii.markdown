NSFW: Curse words in screenshotted tweets.

I go home and mope around for the rest of the day, reading over news articles and watching random people on Reddit and other forums make wild assumptions and accusations. The conspiracy theorists and false flag weirdos popped up immediately and got into flame wars with students. School was called off for the forseeable future. Our silly English free write was cancelled. It was time to self-reflect.

### The Aftermath

Frankly, I do not remember much of the next couple days. I originally thought that I left on a college visit to Georgia Tech the day after the stabbing but apparently that was later. I looked through some poorly worded, angry tweets to piece it all back together. The stabbing happened on a Wednesday and nothing of interest happened on the Thursday or Friday after as we all regathered out composure.

#### Attention Seeking

I will preface this by saying I am guilty of this as well for all those likes and favorites and retweets feed my ego. Now an event like this is not something you dust under the rug, but quite a few people stretched it for all that it was worth and possibly more to keep themselves in the spotlight. Most people wanted out of it quick, but certain people who allegedly performed heroic acts were determined to become national superstars.

The #FRStrong hashtag started appearing within hours of the stabbing and quickly took off across social media. I think that particular hashtag originated from #BostonStrong following the marathon bombing a year prior, but I am not entirely sure. In any case, after seeing people use it, I made a silly little profile picture by slapping navy blue Helvetica text on a white background and made it my Twitter profile picture. It spread pretty quickly and apparently got on TV at some point. I do not have any proof of that, but it got reposted by some local personalities. I was kind of proud of that.

#### Fake News

The fake news meme really took off in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, but it has been around forever. Nothing matches the frustration of listening to someone talk about a subject you are an expert on. After the stabbing, a slew of Twitter accounts representing our high school popped up tweeting misinformation and begging for followers. Many of these were characterized by poor grammar and spelling and were far from official. All of them still exist and have been inactive for years. This whole part pissed me off. I have nothing good to add and these tweets say it all.

#### The Ugly

One particular incident stands out in my mind as one of the most cringe inducing moments I have ever witnessed. The following Tuesday was the last day off before classes resume so they held a candlelight vigil at the local community park. It was just down the road from my house, otherwise I probably would not have bothered going. There were a good 250 or so people there though. A bunch of old dudes I have seen around town give the usual generic speeches about enduring and staying strong. Our principal finishes up and then asks the crowd if anybody would like to come up and say anything.

You can probably see where this is going. The crowd is silent and then a little boy steps forward. I recognize him. He was a really awkward, short, little freshman I have seen around in band. This cannot end well. He goes up to the microphone vacated by our principal and leads off with something like, "Though this whole ordeal may seem like a bad thing, it might have actually been a good thing." Oh. My. God. He did not actually say that. There was a pause. I looked around and people were giving each other the most incredulous looks.

I understood what he probably meant in that it brought the community together and a lot of tension was broken up at least temporarily as a result of the tragedy. It was just extremely poorly executed. He stammered a few more words about the community and slowly trailed off as the crowd's glare pierced his soul. There was no graceful way to salvage this. I felt so bad for him. He stared for a few more seconds before walking away, completely defeated. An awkward silence ensued before our principal thankfully retook his position at the microphone and issued his concluding remarks. Poor kid was probably more tramautized by that experience than by the stabbing itself.

#### Ending On A High Note

Rewind back a few days. On the first Saturday after the stabbing, an event was held for students at the local dek hockey rink. It was pretty fun to be honest. A couple friends and I played in a little kids play pen which was actually pretty legit. Looking back, it was amazing something like that happened and we could bounce back so quick. We hopped around talking to people we know. I attempted to roller blade. That was not fun. However, this was probably my greatest takeaway from the night.

I remember it quite fondly. It was the first time she had ever hugged me. No, there is no love story. There is no happy ending. Actually, there probably is for her. Mine is still up in the air, but perhaps we will find out one day.
