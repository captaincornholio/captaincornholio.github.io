I really should be studying for finals in two weeks, but I finished a bunch of final projects and had a long weekend so I figure I would do some takeaways from a weekend in State College. We had our conference championships or sectionals tournament hosted by Penn State (cue Harold bot). College frisbee has sectionals, regionals, and nationals. X number of teams from sectionals can make it to regionals and twenty teams from all the regionals make it to nationals. The goal of the B team is to make regionals every year. We play in the B team conference which only earned one bid to regionals so we had to win the tournament to keep our season alive.

### An Early Morning

Usually for travelling tournaments (tournaments are mostly two days), we set out Friday night and stay in a hotel that night as well as Saturday night. For this tournament, we decided to leave early Saturday morning to save money. So I roll out of bed at 5:00 AM, microwave some egg rolls, and roll out in the driver's seat with three others fifteen minutes later. I have made this drive up to State College many times and know the roads really well. Trying not to fall asleep, I downed a bottle of stanky Venom Energy Drink Mango (which I will never buy again) I got from IGA during their close out sale for twenty-five cents.

I guess I let my guard down as I cruised through the speed-trap towns. I have been waiting for this moment since the day I got my driver's permit and it finally happened five years after I started driving. I saw the cop on the right and braked to slow down, but it was too late. Busted for doing 65 in a 45. In my weak defense, I was ten car lengths away from the Speed Limit 55 sign, but I did not argue it. After all those years of speeding, it was about time I got one. I was not too upset, but it is time to grow up. It is time to drive like an adult.

Trooper Albert was gracious and let me off with a five over and no points to my license and a nice little $130 fine. I barely reacted while the other guys in the car were freaking out over how high the fine was. Perhaps I should check my privilege one of these days. With that eventual life lesson out of the way, I made an illegal lane change and sped off away from Ebensburg being careful only doing a maximum of ten over.

### Day 1

The stanky Venom Energy started making me shake and that was weird, but we arrived at the Penn State intramural fields at eight and are greeted by groggy frisbee players from around the region. Many of us were not too pleased to be here. The quality of teams in our B team pools and bracket were not too high. Thus when we beat Ohio State B 13-9 in the first game of the day, we were pissed. That is not what the score should have been. How can a team that has beaten the A teams of Miami, Kentucky, and Xavier have a B team score nine points on it? We followed that up with unimpressive 13-4 and 13-5 wins over UPenn B and Temple B, respectively. Our flow had returned somewhat, but it was nowhere near what we have shown all season.

We had one game left on Saturday against Oberlin B, but we had a bye before that. There was not much to do. Some watched Pitt A take IUP A out to pasture with a 13-0 win. Some called up local friends and hung out. Others like me decleated and took a long nap in the lucious Penn State intramural grass. 3:00 rolls around and we start preparing for our game when Oberlin B asked to forfeit. Wow... We literally asked them before our bye if they wanted to forfeit and they said no. Wow... They made us wait two hours in the hot sun for no reason. Needless to say, the whole day left a pretty sour taste in our mouths, especially me with that energy drink.

### Better Tastes

We pull up to our Super 8 Motel and are surprised to find one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. They had free cookies, neat decorations, glass elevators, no bugs, and wifi that actually worked. (On a completely unrelated note, I realized I had no idea what wifi actually meant. I guessed it meant "wireless fidelity" but it apparently [has no meaning and was created by members of the Wi-Fi Alliance](https://www.howtogeek.com/259000/what-does-the-fi-in-wi-fi-mean/).) After cleaning ourselves up, we went to dinner at Chen's Mongolian Buffet a couple of blocks down Atherton and were greeted by some of the best soup and stir fry I have ever had. I mean that was some of the best hot and sour soup I have had in my life. I recommend everyone try that place out. Seriously.

Apparently the buffet was not enough for us so we head out to the Penn State Creamery decked out in our Pitt gear and got our fair share of disapproving looks. I got the Peachy Paterno and it was the best ice cream I have had in a long time, though that might be because I do not eat much ice cream. There has to be something that should be said about the irony(?) of eating Paterno ice cream in my Pitt T-shirt, but I was too tired to think of it. We went back to the hotel and promptly fell asleep.

### Day 2

We were jolted awake by our teammate's 6:45 AM alarm blasting the Pitt victory song. Classic. I reach over and check my phone and saw a text from a Penn State friend I had asked to come out and say hi and watch a bit of our games. Apparently, her boyfriend had gotten sick and she was up til five taking care of him. Damn, that is love. I hope I can find someone who cares that much. Last time I got sick, no one knew and the most I wished for was to not accidentally knock over the pot of boiling water I was using to make tea as I was dry heaving into a ripped paper bag, but I digress. I hope he feels better soon.

In a continuation of the dankness of this Super 8, I make the best waffle I have ever made in my life. I have no idea why this one was so good because I am pretty sure the batter and waffle machines are universal for most of these chain hotels, but it was the greatest waffle ever. It was time to prep for another gameday. Day two of the tournament took the top eight teams from pool play and placed them in a bracket. Our first game was against West Chester B.

The Super 8 did not have any bagels, but we ended up getting one as we took the poor team 15-0. That was when the wind picked up. Wind frisbee is horrible frisbee. The worst teams are able to compete with the best teams as downwind points come easily and upwind points are extremely difficult to pull off. Teams usually end up trading points until a team manages to scores upwind or the points (or time) cap is reached. The best example of this was a game at the high school state championships a couple years back when we played Archbishop Carroll in 30mph winds. We were not that great a team that year, yet we traded points with a top-eight seeded team until they finally managed to score upwind and get a two point lead and proceeded to comfortably trade points the rest of the game. In the *ultimate* twist of fate, the coach of the Archbishop Carroll team was at this tournament cheering on his son who plays for Pitt B.

Our semi-finals game was a rematch with Ohio State B. We got two upwind breaks in the first half and traded for a comfortable 10-6 win. The finals game against Case Western B turned out similarly as we again got two upwind breaks early and finished 11-6. We had qualified for regionals. At this point, we were glad to finally be done as the wind made points long and frustrating. After doing our usual post-tournament debriefing and pictures, we hopped in our cars and headed home.

### The Easter Effect

Or rather, we headed towards the Creamery for some more ice cream only to find it closed. Oh right, it was Easter. Most of us had forgotten. So *that's* why so many people had gone home for the weekend as seen on their Snapchat Stories. A group of Penn State students got there the same time and one girl made a remark along the lines of, "I forget that they celebrate non-Jewish holidays." Wow... When I got home, I found many of the restaurants closed as well due to Easter. Luckily I had my trusty Chinese place down the road. Thank Jesus.

### The Long Road Home

So with my new driving style in mind, I made sure to not go more than ten above the posted speed limit. While I found it slow at times (well duh), I also found it much more relaxing and I did not lose much time on the road and probably got much better gas mileage. I saw a sign that Ebensburg was coming up. *Triggered*. As I approached, I saw police lights on the shoulder. No way. It can't be. It was the same intersection. I shift into the left lane and glance over. Sure enough, it was Trooper Albert. What a baller, pulling over degenerates left and right, east and west.

It would be too much to ask for the rest of the trip to be uneventful. We were just about fifteen minutes away from Pitt on the Parkway West when all hell broke lose above us. The rain came down like a blanket. I literally could not see ten feet above me. It was the thickest rain I have ever seen. I slow down from sixty-five (ten above fifty-five) to around fifteen and half expect to be rear-ended. Cars all around throw on their four-way flashers and traffic slows to a standstill. We speculate as to how many accidents happened in front of us. To our collective surprise, there were none. Except for the dude who tried to pass everyone on the shoulder, everyone remained calm and civilized in the massive cloudburst. My faith in drivers grew quite a bit.

So how long will I keep this charade of following speed limit norms? Only time will tell, but I feel like it is a step in the right direction.
