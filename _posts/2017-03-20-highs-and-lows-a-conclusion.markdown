# Concluding Remarks

I am setting a dangerous precedence for myself by writing something everyday. There is no way I can maintain posting at this frequency, or maybe I can. Anyway, so when I woke up this morning, I was expecting to still be frustrated about the loss Duke took and the vanishing of my chance to win seventy dollars, but I was not. I barely thought about basketball which makes sense given that I am not a basketball fan. So I am glad that part is over. It was honestly pretty stressful and time consuming watching games that do not matter at all (Saint Mary's vs VCU for instance) in my bracket or the tournament. I do not know if I will even watch the rest of the games unless it is with friends and beers, but I hope Michigan or South Carolina pull it off (now that I wrote this, they will both lose their next games).

On the other hand, Ryan Newman is still a winner. *I* felt like a winner for sticking through as a fan after all those weeks and months and years. It is time I could finally afford to buy a Ryan Newman race-win diecast since I was a high schooler with no income the last time he won.

# NASCAR Diecast

I guess a little background on NASCAR diecast is necessary here. NASCAR diecast are replica NASCAR models made by a die casting process. They are most commonly found in scales of 1/24 and 1/64. 1/24 diecasts are about eight inches long and feature opening hoods and trunks as well as rubber tires. 1/64 diecasts are the size commonly referred to as "Hot Wheels sized" and are about three inches long. 1/18, 1/43, 1/87, and 1/144 sizes have also been manufactured but were never popular with the collectors. The prices have steadily risen over the past decade but have steadied over the last two years. 1/24 diecasts are $69.99 while 1/64 diecasts are $7.99.

Diecasts are currently manufactured by Lionel which is better known for its model trains. They took over the diecast production from Action Collectibles a couple years back. One very popular type of diecast is the race-win diecast. A race-win diecast is a replica of the car that was in victory lane after the celebration which includes confetti and any sustained on-track damage which have made for some unique diecasts over the years. Due to the detail required, race-win diecasts are generally only offered in the 1/24 scale and thus they are more expensive.

Another aspect of diecast production is minimum order quantity or MOQ. The cost of producing a diecast is not in the metal or paint or decals or shipping, but rather licensing fees of all the manufacturer, sponsor, team, and driver logos. Before a diecast goes into production, it begins with a polling stage in which a minimum number of diecast must be pre-ordered or plans for the diecast will be scrapped and the pre-orders will be refunded. After the financial crisis, NASCAR diecast orders have remained rather low and some major drivers have not met MOQ requirements for their race-win diecast (though who wants to buy five Kyle Busch race-win diecasts every year). I am not too worried about Newman's diecast not meeting MOQ because he has a decent fan base and his race-win diecast market is not oversaturated since his last race win diecast was produced in 2012. The diecast of the 2013 win was never offered because his paint scheme featured the Smurfs as a promotion and the movie studio did not give permission to have it produced which I do not understand since it is basically free advertising.

So instead of waiting for the diecast to perhaps appear on eBay half a year from now, I did my part and pre-ordered it. I had a five percent coupon too for being a loyal NASCAR diecast purchasing member.
