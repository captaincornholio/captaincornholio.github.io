So I guess the prom story is kind of depressing (there is more) so I will spice it up with something more exciting. During my junior year of college, I picked up a bizarre hobby, sports gambling. The one moment that inspired me to start was the Alabama vs Chattanooga college football game during the fall of 2016. Of course Alabama was going to win so I was wondering, why not just throw the whole house on Alabama? Even if the return is really small, it is free money after all. Oh how wrong I was.

# It Is Illegal...

So my first task was to find a sportsbook. That is where you can find lines and place bets. After some online searching, I settled for Bovada. Its lines are admittedly not the best, but the site had a low minimum deposit, a low minimum withdrawal, and was reportedly pretty safe. Online sports gambling is not legal in most jurisdictions within the United States so most of the sportsbooks are hosted offshore. They could theoretically randomly shut down one day and keep all of the users' money or not pay out winnings when requested and there is nothing we can do about it. Is it not ironic that sports gambling in itself is a gamble? Luckily, I did not have any funny business during my short-lived tenure as a gambler.

# It Is Addicting...

So I made my Bovada account and deposited the minimum of twenty dollars (there was also a "bonus" of fifty percent so I technically started out with thirty dollars, but Bovada has strange bonus rules, but that is not relevant for now). The goal was to either meet the minimum withdrawal of fifty dollars, take my money, and leave forever or lose it all, delete my account, and leave forever. I made a list of ten plays I was going to make over the course of the college football bowl season (one thing I learned is that betting on bowls is dangerous due to many outside factors including staffing changes, players not trying / playing to prepare for the draft, and general lack of motivation), then see where I was from there.

I remember the outcome of the first play I ever made. I had Idaho (+15) over Colorado State (more on what that means later) in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. I did no research. I simply favored Idaho because they basically had home field advantage since the game took place at the Boise State field. I put the game on at a friend's Christmas party and could not look away despite Idaho taking a massive lead early on and the football game itself being of low quality. My reaction and celebration after winning the bet was probably inappropriate given the fact I made eighty-seven cents on a one dollar bet. I think my shirt came off at some point.

After that, I was hooked. Okay, not exactly, but whenever I had free time, I would be staring at the live betting interface and making small plays on lines, spreads, and props. I realized this would not be a sustainable lifestyle once I returned to school so I figured I had to win fast. I watched pointless games and made pointless bets. I made twenty cents on a seven dollar bet on the Bahamas Bowl not going into overtime. Of course, small amounts add up over time, but one big loss is demoralizing and may lead to chasing. That is when a gambler makes increasingly larger bets to make up for the money lost on previous bets. You can probably guess how that turns out.

I bet on various sports mostly based on tailing what other people said. I have no knowledge of European Premier League soccer or Turkish basketball but I made plays there. They were not big plays, but when your entire bankroll fluctuates between ten and twenty dollars, every play is significant. However, I did pick up on a few strategies despite my limited knowledge of certain sports. For example, I would always bet on hockey scores hitting the over right before the third period since teams pull their goalie in the last few minutes. This was a bet I never lost which is saying a lot.

By betting on heavily favored teams or outcomes, I was able to slowly chisel my way upwards gradually ten or twenty cents at a time. However, I also had to wager a lot to gain a little and strange things happen in sports so it is impossible to stay perfect and I suffered quite a few setbacks. This saga will continue, but for now I will leave the first ten plays of my gambling career. Stay tuned to find out how they did (or I guess you can just Google the results).
