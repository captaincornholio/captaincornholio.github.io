# Greetings

Greetings, I am Captain Cornholio. No, that is not my real name, but there is a story behind that. I have tossed around the idea of starting a blog for years now but was never motivated enough to do so. This past year, a couple friends and I discovered a blog being run by a friend from high school. This greatly influenced me to get up and running. In fact, I am using the same hosting service and a similar layout as his blog so credit goes out to him.

Now that is out of the way, let me introduce myself. I am [Captain Cornholio](/about). It might be a pen name, a nickname, an alter-ego, or an indepedent entity. In any case, I am not entirely sure. For the purpose of this blog, we shall assume it is just a pen name.

## Why a pen name?

I used to be quite active on the Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media with my real name and was quite outspoken about certain topics. After awhile, I realized that the vast majority of "friends" and "followers" really did not care about my beliefs and posts and vice versa for the most part. This lead to the birth of the Captain. The Captain was developed in the winter of 2014 and was the face behind a private Twitter account that I only allowed my closest and trusted friends to follow. Inside the private Twitter, I would post musings, ideas, rants, and poorly taken pictures. There are many posts in there that should never be seen by the general public and I would risk my career if word of that got out. It has been three years, no calls, so I am fine on that end I suppose, but the Twitter has definitely calmed down over the years.

So why did I choose Vault Boy as my mascot? I have no idea. I never even played Fallout. I rarely played video games that were not sports. There was just something about that wink and sly smile that drew me in. I hope I am not breaking any sort of copyright law (I probably am), but he has represented me well for the past three years. As for name itself, I am not sure where that came from. I guess it is one of those *random* things high schoolers come up with. I am aware there is a character on Beavis and Butthead named the Great Cornholio, but I was not aware of that since I never watched the show.

There is a level of anonymity I want to maintain when writing this blog, but that is made difficult because it limits what I can write about. Names, locations, and specific details will vary depending on what I deem appropriate to publish. This will probably adapt over time as I try to pinpoint who actually reads this (probably no more than five or ten people I have in mind) and figure out if something like this ever turns up in search engines. At some point, I would like to start posting pictures that may include myself and detailed stories that would allow my information to be found without much effort. As for now, I just want to see where this blog takes me. I do not know how committed to this I will be, but I hope for this to be a deeper analysis of my thoughts and observations that can not fit inside 140 characters on Twitter. Or it could just devolve into trash just like my Twitter. Only time will tell.
