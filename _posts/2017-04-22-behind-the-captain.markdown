April 22nd is a strange day in my life, yet it is not something I can readily share. It is the day the Captain began spewing nonsense and stories and occasionally a clever thought into the Twittersphere. Technically, that is not completely true, but let us delve into the story behind the bizarre Twitter persona.

### #BLURREDLINES

Way back in 2013, there was a song released by a little known artist named Robin Thicke. Sure he had a semi-major hit in 2007, but being honest, none of us remember that. Blurred Lines, a bassy, poppy, funny, semi-misogynistic tune, took over the radio airwaves that summer on its way to the throne as the number one song of the year according to the Billboard Hot 100 algorithm. On a semi-related note, I dressed up as Robin Thicke for the Halloween band parade that year. Of all the dumb rules and enforcement they have in high school, looking back, I am honestly really surprised they let me get away with that. There were impressionable froshmore girls watching...

So Blurred Lines came out the summer between my junior and senior years of high school and also around the last time Ryan Newman won a race until a couple weeks ago. Anyway, that meant college and scholarship applications. I applied for quite a few meme scholarships for pocket change and some of them would give extra entries if you tweeted a link. Not wanting to spam loyal friends and followers and turn into an advertisement, I created a second Twitter account in October 2013 with the handle of @_____________rx for the sole purpose of fulfilling those scholarship opportunities. I forget what I named the account, but it was just a simple blue egg (which Twitter recently got rid of and replaced with faceless head avatars like Facebook which breaks my heart).

At some point, I realized that was dumb and deleted all those tweets. On October 27th, 2013, I sent the only tweet from that year, "Hello there". At some point, I came up with the oh-so-clever name of "Throbbin Dicke" and assigned the name to the Twitter account. I wonder if there is a specific word for that. It is not a portmanteau. The closest thing is a spoonerism with "Robin Thicke", but not quite. Oh well, that is beyond the point and thus Throbbin was born, but I did not use him for the few following months.

### The Early Days

Throbbin remained on the backburner through the fall semester of senior year and into the winter. He had amassed a few followers from the most loyal of my real life friends, but he had no content to share. For reasons unknown, he came to life during Super Bowl XLVIII where the Broncos were humiliated by the Seahawks. I thought it would be funny to tweet out hashtags from all the Super Bowl commercials (there were much fewer hashtags used in this year's Super Bowl, really makes you think). With Throbbin loaded onto my trusted HTC Evo 4G LTE, I began to tweet regularly with him mostly complaining and occasionally posting a goofy picture or joke about certain peers that would be social suicide if I tweeted from my primary account. To be honest, I really wish there was a trendy word for a fake Twitter account kind of like "finsta" for fake Instagram account.

February 22nd, 2014 is a day very near and dear to my heart and I will probably go in depth on that day at some point. The important part of that day for this story is the adoption of Captain Cornholio as a persona of mine. I came up with the name a few months back when I made it my Reddit username, but when it was entered on the screen at the bowling alley, he and I became one. See, I felt I was always the Captain, never Throbbin. Tweeting with Throbbin made me feel like an imposter. I felt he was too radical and easy to anger to represent me. He had to go.

### The Homicide

I continued to tweet through Throbbin up to and through the stabbing until the fateful day of April 22nd, 2014. From that day forward, my tweets will appear under the name of Captain Cornholio. Now comes the question of do I start a clean account for Captain or do I keep all the tweets I made under Throbbin's name. After some deliberation, I decided there were enough personally significant tweets that warranted transferring them to the new account. Only problem is that Twitter does not allow transferring tweets between accounts.

The obvious thing is to rename the Throbbin account and handle and forget Throbbin ever existed, but it was not that easy for me. I remain attached to things. Throbbin and @_____________rx were still a part of me for almost six months. So after I renamed the Throbbin account to Captain Cornholio and assigned it @captcornholio as its handle, I created a new account with Throbbin's old profile picture, handle, background, and information and kept it as a memorial for my short-lived comrade. Now for exactly three years, I have been tweeting under the name of Captain Cornholio and have expanded to other forms of social media using the name including Instagram, Snapchat, and Kik. What a strange life I live.

As for Throbbin, do not fret, for our dear comrade pays us a visit every year.
