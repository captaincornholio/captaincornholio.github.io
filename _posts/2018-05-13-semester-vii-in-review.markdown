Another semester has come and gone. Let's sit back and reflect on what happened.

### Senior Spring

It's weird going into a semester in which everybody else is graduating but you have to hang around for another one in the fall so the grind continued. No one wants to hear about me doing schoolwork but this was by far the busiest semester I have ever had of school. I would hesitate to call it he most difficult however. Two classes featured intensive semester-long group project while a third class featured a half-semester-long group project. I had never had any major issues surrounding group projects so it was about time the bad luck cycled around to me. 

#### Senior Design

Senior design is supposed to be fun class. Groups of three or four people work together to build a device with both original hardware and software to solve a problem they chose. The first homework assignment was to pick an idea. I'm not much of an ideas person so I just scribbled down something about a football that automatically detects whether or not it was caught thinking back to the controversial Jesse James decision just a few weeks prior. I was hoping some of my classmates would have better ideas, but I obviously expected too much of them as the same repetitive ideas of lighting systems and home security systems popped up repeatedly.

I had faith in my idea though and tried to recruit others to join but was unable to since they had all formed their groups beforehand which we were explicitly told not to do and I stupidly listened. Instead, I ended up with two commuter students whose initials both happened to be "JG". All the work Jeff Gordon did to build up the reputation of those letters will forever be undone by these two. To say they contributed absolutely nothing to the project would be inaccurate. I legitimately had to put in extra effort to undo their attempts to improve the football. I single-handedly designed the software, constructed the hardware, and made every single presentation and video. At the end, I garnered the respect of my professors and classmates with *my* project which actually worked. Everyone says you will always have bad group members in the work environment, but that has not been the case. *Everyone* I have worked with at IQ have been knowledgable, accountable, and genuinely good people. Even at the Boston Market, they may not have been the nicest, but they all got their assigned work done. I guess my biggest takeaway is that working with friends will always be the best option.

#### Databases

But what if those friends are well-intentioned and simply are not good at what they are doing. For my databases class, we had to get into groups of four and write SQL scripts and a set of Java drivers to manipulate a database. The project ended up being easy enough and I probably could have done it on my own. However, one of the requirements was distributing the work evenly which the professor could verify on Github. So I was forced to let others do some coding. I knew I was in for a fun time when they kept asking me why their code wouldn't compile repeatedly at 3AM. Once I got it to compile, I actually looked at the code they wrote and there were all sorts of formatting and functionality errors which I quietly fixed. Eventually, we just decided to have me finish the whole thing which I did not oppose. At the same time, these guys were all seniors entering the workforce and one of them already has a job lined up after graduation. They are all good people unlike the senior design guys and we have gone drinking together so I hope they get their stuff together when the real world calls.

#### Trains

Well here is a group (minus one person) I *know* will do well in the real world. We have a legendary class at Pitt called Software Engineering which has been taught by the same guy for almost two decades. The project is the same every year: write a software in any language to model a train control system. Many before us have told us the stories of the class and it was finally our time to take on this rite of passage.

I walk in on my first day wishing I had coordinated with friends so we can have a group ready for this class. I plop down and in walks Ryan who I had gotten close with following many late nights in 1223. Then Sara walks in. I was confused because she was an electical engineer, but as it turns out, she is using this as her technical elective, respect. We recruit Carlos and Kaylene who Ryan has worked with previously in robotics so our group was set, or so we thought.

A week later, a very awkward kid (we shall call him Josh) approached us asking if he could join our group. We looked at each other uneasily. Josh is one of those kids who sits in the front of every class and plays games on his laptop while trying to suck up to the professors. At least he's probably a hard worker, so I give him the nod. We have frequent team meetings because previous groups urged us that this was the way to go (shout outs to Tyler and Kevin for guiding our way). Our team bonded while Josh would show up occasionally and leave early without any excuses. We started uploading our code to Github and when we asked Josh to, he would always respond with "it's not ready" or "I need to rework my module". At our first presentation, we were supposed to do live demonstrations of early concepts of our code and Josh shows up with a PowerPoint of screenshots despite us having a long conversation about how we were supposed to present. We thought this was the kick in the ass he needed. Alas, we could not be more wrong.

Our spring break was filled with discussions about what to do about Josh. Sara approached our professor about talking to Josh and the professor went super saiyan and kicked Josh out of the group on the spot. Ironically, everybody except me wanted to kick him out. I don't even remember my justifications but the majority ended up making the correct decision. With the burden lifted off our shoulders, we got rolling to make the best train software ever. Josh did not have to make the entire train module on his own, just the part that he was assigned with hard coded inputs that would be other modules. The last we heard from him was three weeks after he was kicked out when he texted us if he could borrow Ryan's code. I promptly kicked him out of our Github.

Two weeks before finals, we had a system demonstration of our software and we rocked the house. We and another group by far had the best software and I would give the edge to us because I am biased. So it was Josh's turn to do a solo presentation for his module and he opened a PowerPoint and began rambling about how his code doesn't run. Ryan whispered to me, "That's because he doesn't have any code," while Sara put her head on her desk in embarrassment. To put this in persective, each group's presentation should be thirty to forty-five minutes so proportionately, his should have been around six to nine minutes. His lasted thirty seconds and featured a bunch of Photoshopped screenshots which would probably have been acceptable three months earlier.

Oh boy, it gets worse. So during finals week, we had our final demonstration which was similar to the system demonstration, just with more features and a more polished look. We got a lot more accomplished than the other group that was close to us and had by-far the most functionality. Relieved it was all over, we returned and began wondering if Josh was going to actually have code to present. Ryan laughed and said he probably had another PowerPoint. He was right. Sara got up and left the room. I put my head down feeling embarrassed for Josh. It is clear that Josh isn't completely there upstairs but this was beyond comprehension. He seemed oblivious to the secondhand embarrassment palpitating through the room as he showed off the same screenshots from two weeks earlier at a volume that was slightly too loud and fast. Kaylene muttered to me, "I hope he fails to preserve the sanctity of Pitt's computer engineering program." Wow Kaylene, you put what I wanted to say in much nicer words.

For what it's worth, Josh is a commuter student. What is up with commuter students and being bums? Ryan is also a commuter student and is one of the hardest working guys I know. He probably leeched the life out of all the other commuters. Ryan was in the first class I ever attended at Pitt, MATH 0235 at 10AM on August something 2014. Ryan and I worked together in 0257, 0501, 1502, 1541, and simply hung out and drank together a bunch. He is graduating unlike the four of us so I made a tribute video commemorating his graduation and our train group as a whole.

Oh and we made an intramural frisbee team and actually won a game.

### Frisbee

So how did frisbee go? Pretty much as expected. We regressed a bit from last year but had solid core on Pitt-B. We fell to Florida-B in finals in Florida. Our Delaware tournament got cancelled due to a freak snowstorm. We performed pretty poorly at a tournament in Columbus where I finally got to face off against Luke's Notre Dame for the first time. They ended up winning the whole thing. I skipped our sectionals tournament so I could work on the football and trains, but we won the whole thing and got a bid to regionals.

The regionals tournament was in Columbus at the same location as our tournament earlier in the season. For the third time in four years, we had to play Pitt-A in pool play. A slow start cost us the game against Case Western who got out to a 6-1 lead but only ended up beating us by three. The game against Pitt-A was on-serve for the first five points which resulted in a lot of harsh words from the coaches and parents on the sidelines while we celebrated excessively after scoring the most points on Pitt-A in program history. A blown 6-2 lead against Dayton ended our Saturday of on a sour note. Sunday was my last day of sanctioned collegiate ultimate ever as I run out of eligibility. We lose a nailbiter to Penn and pick up a consolation win over a Wright State that had already mentally checked out. I am not a big fan of the club circuit so this might be the last competitive tournament of my career. However, I sense some party tournaments on the horizon.

### Random Thoughts

The following are just random things that happened.

#### We Like Sportz

The college football national championship is the same day as my birthday so we have a party and watch Alabama take down Georgia and glasses kicker. Zach, Jae, and I attempt to attend as many basketball games as we could. The Kevin Stallings era made this less than enjoyable resulting in us being the only D1 school to be winless in conference play. The March Madness tournament rolls around and we watch UMBC shock the world and Loyola Chicago and Sister Jean make it far only for a #1 seed to take it all. I guess that's what's supposed to happen. Mr. Burns wins the 2018 edition of the Gooch Squad bracket challenge.

I watch curling for a few weeks during the Canadian national championship. The first match I ever saw was Kerri Einarson defeating Jennifer Jones who she had never beaten in seventeen tries. Einarson ultimately ended up losing to Jones in the finals. I still watch NASCAR but not as much anymore due to the poor performance of Newman's team and his tendency to crash more this year for some reason. He is nearing the end of his career and like I have said before, I don't really see myself actively seeking out NASCAR once he retires.

#### New and Old Hobbies

I picked Clash of Clans and Clash Royale back up. Often, my roommates were not home and when I wanted to just relax around the house, I would not have much to do. We didn't have many TV channels and I'm not a big fan of watching TV anyway so why not bring the barbs back out? They were just ways of passing time and chilling out after long days of class and projects.

My mom made me put more money into my Roth IRA which I had filled the past couple of years and let it sit there. When I realized I could invest my money, I began studying the stock market by examining Reddit and Twitter memes. I put some money on some solid, long-term stocks. Then I put the rest on Canadian weed stocks because it's the green wave that everybody saw coming. I also began dabbling in penny stocks and have seen some pretty decent returns for what was basically guessing which stock would be pump-and-dumped next.

#### The Jerb Search

So since I am graduating in the fall, I wanted to go somewhere new for an internship. Apparently, that's a lot easier said than done. I began applying for west coast summer gigs in January and ended up applying to about twenty-five. I only ever heard back from five. Of those, Disney gave me a phone interview where she seemed to be interested in me and said she would forward my information to the relevant directors. I never heard back.

Not too upset, I began planning the ultimate road trip that would take up the whole summer and go coast-to-coast twice. The only thing holding me back was the cost which would easily go into the upper four-figures. I then got an email from IQ who said they wanted to discuss having me back for the summer despite previously saying they did not have room for me. I was starting to look forward to my road trip so we struck a deal of working two months for IQ to finish a single project. After I was done which would be in mid-July, I would be free to do whatever I would like. From a monetary perspective, this is a win-win.

#### The Social

##### Suthy 6

The old friend group did not meet as much anymore but we began going to trivia night. We ended up winning on February 7 which was Kevin's birthday and later on May 3 which happened to be the only two I attended. We had a few other tame get togethers hosted at Ellers which mostly involved sitting around drinking beer and ordering food over Uber eats. That was about all. They were all busy with jobs, their coursework, and grad school stuff. Time flew past us fast and I probably won't see many of them again.

##### Frisbee Friends

I always found it hard to gauge how close I am with people on the frisbee team. We are all friends for the most part and have conversations and swipe each other into Market and stuff. We would chill on Cathy lawn and toss and play ping-pong at Nordy's when it was too cold out. We hosted a crate race and several mixers the latter of which weren't too fun. I guess I never really figured those out.

I had an interesting conversation with one of the guys on Pitt-B a week or two before finals week. A couple people we were close to were graduating and we were wondering if we would stay in contact. He felt like we were close, but it was a different sort of closeness. We have all seen each other at our best and at our worst whether on the field or yakking into a bathtub at 2AM, yet it didn't feel the same as classical friendships such as the Kevins or our high school group. I have no problem hanging out or talking one-on-one with pretty much everyone on the team, but I haven't really seeked anyone out to hang out with and vice versa. Could it be because we all already see each other three or four times a week? I guess that's one way to get closer to someone, but it just never really happened to me for a specific person on Pitt-B.

##### The Old Guard

Nothing much to write home about here. Don't recall getting a chance to see anyone over the semester. The girls have pretty much all faded away except Jessi. Guys have been in contact to a similar extent. Dan calls semi-regularly telling of stories from the jailyard.

##### The Search Goes On...

My shelf-life for dating in college has pretty much expired. I didn't see anything changing during my last two semesters. I haven't given up per se, but the workload this semester didn't help my case. I didn't go out as much as I wanted to and when I did, there wasn't the opportunity to meet anyone new, guys or girls. The few matches I got on Tinder didn't go past a couple of texts and I've lost any charm I may have had years ago. As for her, I haven't contacted her all semester and she hasn't reached out at all. Yet every time, I see her name in passing, I know I haven't moved on yet.

This has increasingly bothered me the last couple of semesters and I am afraid that it will start to affect my work life. Everyone tells me the same old regurgitated phrases, "just put yourself out there", "it'll happen when you least expect it", etc., etc. I'm still young, but everything's passing by faster and faster and sometimes I wonder if my chances have passed me by.

Whatever the case, I don't see anything happening this calendar year so might as well focus on what's real. I got a road trip to plan and have my fourth first day at IQ tomorrow.
