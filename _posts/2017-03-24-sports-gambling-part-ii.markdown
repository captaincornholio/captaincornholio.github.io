![Better question is who are these teams?](\assets\img\spreads_and_stuff.png)

What does this even mean?

# Spreads

So what do these words and numbers mean? I see them in the newspaper (which does not make sense since sports gambling is illegal where these papers are printed) and on sports articles on ESPN. I will attempt to explain with the limited amount of sports gambling knowledge I have.

I play frisbee so I will use frisbee examples. Pittsburgh-B is regarded as one of the best B teams in the country. Franciscan is a D3 frisbee team located in Ohio and won the 2015 D3 National Championship. Let us assume Pittsburgh-B and Franciscan have a matchup on Sunday in Ohio. Let us also assume the first team to reach fifteen points wins the game.

A bookie's (the dude or company who runs the sportsbook) goal is to make money. They (I am a big fan of the singular they) are not your friend. A points spread is a bookie's interpretation of the final points differential between two teams in a match. They will research the two teams and try to come up with the most likely final score taking into accounts factors such as rosters, depth, injuries, travel distance to the field, win-loss record, quality of wins, quality of losses, individual player matchups, past performance, coaches, etc. With that knowledge in mind, they might determine the most probable score would be a 15-9 win for Franciscan and the following will be published.

> Franciscan (-6) (-110)
> 
> Pittsburgh-B (+6) (-110)

The spread serves as a sort of handicap for both teams. The -6 associated with Franciscan will subtract six points from the team's final score and the team must still win in order for you to win the bet. If the final score is 15-8 or 15-5 for example, the bet will be considered a win. Likewise, if you bet Pittsburgh-B (+6), six points is added to Pittsburgh-B's score so even if Pittsburgh-B loses 15-10, they "cover the spread" and the bet is won. The point spread is what is being referred to when someone might say "Franciscan is a six point favorite." One final note, if the score ends up with a point differential of six, then the bet is considered a "push". Neither side wins and the bookie returns all the wagered money. This is why bookies sometimes add a half point to the spread so the bet will not push.

# Juice

The (-110) that follows is the value of the bet. If there is a minus sign, that is the wager that must be placed to win a hundred dollars. In this case, the gambler has to put down $110 to win $100. An important note is that the original $110 is returned. If the gambler wins the bet, they will walk away with $210 total. The ratio scales up and down so if the gambler wagers $55, they have a chance to win $50. If there is a plus sign instead, that is the amount that could be won on a $100 wager. For example, if the line for a game was (+300) and a gambler wagered $100, they would win $300 in addition to the $100 that is returned to them.

This is the way the bookie makes money. Their goal is to get fifty percent of the action on each side of the spread. If $1,100 is placed on Franciscan (-6) and $1,100 is placed on Pittsburgh-B (+6). The bookie takes in $2,200 and returns $1,100 to the winning bettors, but only pays out $1,000 total to the winners. This leaves $100 for the bookie. This amount is known as the vigorish but is more commonly referred to as the juice.

# Lines

Money lines are a straight-up pick of which team a gambler thinks is going to win a match without the points handicaps. The risk for betting on a favorite is greater than that of the spread, but the reward for betting on an underdog is also greater than that of the spread. A money line for our theoretical frisbee game would look something like this. 

> Franciscan (-1200)
> 
> Pittsburgh-B (+500)

# Over / Under

You have probably heard this term before. It is simply a number provided by the bookie that is their estimate of the sum of the final score. A gambler then bets on the sum of the final score being over or under this number. This is quite popular in basketball betting. An over / under for our theoretical frisbee game would look something like this. 

> Over 24 (-110)
> 
> Under 24 (-110)

Now bookies generally do not bet on their own lines, but I feel like I have some insight on this potential matchup and some insider information. It feels sacrireligious betting against your own team. That is another thing. A gambler can never let emotion and bias affect their decisions, but we are human and this is difficult. In any case, I will take Franciscan (-6) and Under 24. I promise I will not take part in any point shaving.
