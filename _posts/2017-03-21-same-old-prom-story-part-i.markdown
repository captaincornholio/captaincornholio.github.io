# Baby Just Say I'll Defer

Today I was walking down the street and passed the local flower place on Forbes Avenue. I looked inside and there were a bunch of high school age children in there and I was confused for a moment. Then I remembered it is that time of year again. The first day of spring was yesterday. Ultimate frisbee practices are back outdoors. The cargo shorts are coming out in full force. And teenagers are prepping for their major coming-of-age promenade event. I felt like it was a little early so I went on the calendar of the first high schoool I thought of (Thomas Jefferson, I have no idea why) and found out that its prom took place on April 22nd, so it is definitely that time of year now.

Now, I never did go to prom. Do I regret it? Just a little, not as bad as I sometimes joke about. I had plenty of chances, but my priorities were different back then. I considered myself a contrarian (still do, just not to the same extent) preferring that term over edgy teenager. My reasoning? I had better things to do. It was a waste of money. It was a lot of stress. A fair point I had though was that I was not interested in the whole "going as friends" paradigm. Both sides get shafted by the whole prom deal (from what I have seen). Sure, I am making generalities here, but there is no point in going over every single possible edge case. Guys probably have feelings that are unrequited. Girls are worried about their public perception. I have seen plenty of people go as friends and have a great time. If it were me, I would save the hassle and just take her to a nice restaurant and go bowling afterwards behind the Big Lots in Monroeville.

So prom at my high school permitted only juniors and seniors to attend or a sophomore or someone not attending the school under the age of twenty-one *if* they were accompanied by a junior or senior. My sophomore year came and went. A junior girl joked that I was her backup if no one else asked her. Ummm... Okay. I would have much rather have done anything else at the time than go to prom. I guess this was just the byproduct of the lack of maturity that I have shown throughout my entire life. I am not blaming anything or myself, but I am stating how I view the whole situation.

The next year she told me the same thing. Her friend did the same. Luckily, both of them were asked and I could defer my prom decision for one more year. Around this time, I distinctly remember my friend's mum telling me I should go to prom at least once. I promised her I would. Our school's prom that year took place on the same day as the state competition for Science Olympiad. I was in pretty good company as at least one other junior and a senior skipped prom to attend and we brought home the hardware and had dinner at Olive Garden. Great breadsticks.

So senior spring rolls around. We are all laid back, browsing Reddit, raiding villages in Clash of Clans, and goofing off in biology class. Snapchat was just getting started and memes were not yet widespread and ruined by the public. I am still not exactly sure what happened that year. I wanted to go to prom. I told my friends I would. I told my parents I would. I told my friends' parents I would. Every single one of my friends were going including the one junior, now senior, who had accompinied me to Science Olympiad the previous year. The state competition was on the day of prom again this year, but that should have been irrelevant to me. Yet when that day rolled around, there I was on a school bus with a bunch of freshmen and sophomores on the way to a waste of a day in which I did not win a single medal or do anything productive. The Olive Garden dinner was not that great and I began to wonder where it all went wrong.
