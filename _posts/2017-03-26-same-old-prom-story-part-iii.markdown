# A Final Hail Mary

So my freshman year of college goes by in a breeze. Some people were saying I looked and acted depressed, but I am not sure why they said that nor do I remember much of the bad. I guess this is when the phrase "rose-tinted glasses" comes into play. When I think about fall 2014 going into spring 2015, I think of Ryan Newman lucking his way into almost winning a championship in his first season with his new #31 team despite not winning a race. I think of joining one of the best ultimate frisbee B teams in the nation with several upset wins over A teams. I think of my first dorm mates who are still good friends to this day. I think of my first experiences with alcohol (this blog does not condone underage drinking) as well as tobacco (this blog may or may not condone smoking). I think of late nights in the engineering hall and my first conference and so on.

The sophomore girl who asked me a year ago told me I am taking her if no one else does. She told me this more than a couple of times. I thought she was being serious. For all I know she was at the time, but she skirted the question when I asked about it later on, so I guess I will never know. Anyway, I was a freshman making a name for myself at school and on the frisbee field. Why should I take some high schooler to prom? I knew she would have no trouble getting some guy to ask her. In fact, she went with the guy she had always liked. Why should I care? It was time to ace my finals and shock the world with Pitt-B at regionals. By shock the world, I mean we went 1-6, but broke seed from sixteenth to fifteenth by beating West Virginia A.

At this point, maybe during my rising sophomore summer, something inside me clicked or perhaps unclicked. Was it the news that people a couple years older than me I knew were getting engaged? Was it hearing Pitt classmates' high school stories and feeling like I missed out on a lot due to focusing on academics? Was it the realization I gained absolutely no dating experience as a teen? Of course, that was not competely a one-way street, though my reasoning for that is much more personal, but I would be more than willing to discuss that in person if you know where to find me.

I am sure you can see where this is going. This was my last chance. I was under twenty-one. She, now a senior, and the guy she went with the previous year were not together since the latter had a girlfriend. I discussed this with my best friends from high school over Christmas break and they told me to go for it. They even offered to come with me if the opportunity to get dates arose for them. I saw the opportunity and took it. You can call me an idiot now or wait until the end, up to you. 

Anyway, so this was the second weekend in January, obnoxiously early I know, but we know what happens to those who wait. She had an event up here at Pitt, so I intercepted her on her way home and we went for a walk and I showed her around campus. Then I pretty much asked her with a bouquet of flowers from the same flower place I passed a few days back. She smiled and said yes and I kind of felt like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ykWbu2Gl0) and sent out an overconfident tweet. If I were betting, I definitely would have faded myself. It was obvious on the drive home she was uncomfortable about it, but I was too absorbed in my own thoughts and excitement.

I hurry home and tell one of my close friends who was in her grade and has tried to bring us together. She seemed excited and we met up at a McDonald's back home. She seemed uneasy about the whole thing and then told me the guy had broken up with his girlfriend over break and they had already started talking again. Well, I know which direction this is headed and how it will end for me. [Damn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqe55loq9ec&t=46s).

She avoided talking to me for a month afterwards. I honestly do not blame her. This must have been a really awkward situation. She confirmed mid-February it was most likely going to be a no-go. Well, [I tried](https://youtu.be/MS-ymeJlF58?t=34s). It did not help that I suffered a season-ending injury four days later on the second day of our first tournament. I would not play competitive ultimate again until the end of August. To add insult to injury (quite literally),  regionals was the same weekend as prom so I had to sit at home while my friends were having fun at prom and my teammates were winning at regionals.

I totally brought this upon myself, no doubt about that. It does not make it sting less. I guess this should be a learning experience, but I am not exactly sure what I learned that is positive and would help me further down the road. She and I are still friends as of the time of this posting. I will conclude with my attempt to be humorous about the whole situation.
