I had my last final at 8AM on the previous Friday morning. That was it. I was done with junior year. I was unofficially a senior, but there was just one more thing left for the semester, our regional tournament in Allentown.

### A Farewell to Frats

So I lived in a frat house on North Dithridge for the semester after I sublet from a dude who moved in with his girlfriend. It was an interesting experience to say the least, but I may save the specifics for a later post. If not, I will sum it up here. Seven dudes and one girl lived in the house. Of the seven dudes, only four were actually in the frat which led to some weird dynamics. To say the house was unkempt is giving the frat too much credit. It was disgusting. You walk in the front door and the musky smell of old house, weed, and dust fill your nostrils as you are greeted by dilapidated furniture and the mice that run along the floorboards. My room was on the third floor and was salvegable. My only complaints were the lack of heat and AC and the fact that one of the windows was smashed.

It definitely was not the best living conditions, but hey, that is part of the college experience. After my final, I packed my CRV and headed over to my new place for next year on Ellers Street. I was greeted by my friend who I am replacing since he graduated this past semester. He hopped in my car and we liberated a decent amount of furniture from the frat house including a table, drawers, mattresses, and a standing lamp. I feel that was fair payment for having to take out the trash and clean the bathrooms by myself every week. I bid him farewell and good luck in the future and pack my remaining belongings and drive to my dad's work to hand it off to him to take home. Thus, I finished moving out.

### Chilling and Relationship Thoughts

I drive back to campus and grab lunch at the good old Chinese buffet when I get a text from a friend. I meet her down by Schenley Plaza and we lay down on the warm, low-cut grass and just talk about our semester and plans and futures. She is as concerned as ever about the future, but she decided she wanted her first kiss a couple weeks back and got it later that same night. It was an interesting topic of discussion since we are both hopeless romantics with no idea what we are doing. It has been almost two years since I last kissed a girl (yes it actually happened) and I realized how much time has passed since then. Damn. It was kind of an uncomfortable topic of discussion for me, so I dipped and started walking back to the frat house and my car. It was almost time to leave anyway.

The door to the frat was already unlocked and a bunch of the guys were playing FIFA. I grab the remaining stuff I needed for frisbee and left the room I called my home for four months forever. I then return my house and room keys and bid farewell to my housemates. They truly were pretty cool guys and I hope to see them around occasionally. Right before leaving, I bag some frozen food I was going to take back to my house on the way out east. I give Delta Sigma Phi one last look before pulling out onto Dithridge and head out.

My best friends at Pitt lived just a few doors down as well as a girl I knew from high school who coincidentally lived in the same house as them. They provided the majority of the social interaction I had during the past semester. I wonder what will happen now that I will live in West Oakland ten minutes away from them and even further away from most of the activity. Being completely honest, I never found a consistent friend group in college. In high school, I was pretty solidly set early sophomore year with close friends and a number of dependable acquaintances. Now I am a senior in college and I never felt that here. Sure I have a couple of guys and the frisbee team, but something was missing. I never like to believe that there is no chance at recovery, but it seems to me that most people are solidly set into their own groups by now. Oh well, I will keep doing my best, but some things are just not meant to be. I am just worried about how this might affect me in the future in regards to lack of network and social skills, but we will see what happens.

### Friday Night Drives

I pick up the two freshmen I am driving in the parking lot next to Sutherland and we head out. One of our lovely captains volunteered his home in Havertown to house most of the team so we do not have to stay in the shoddy, creepy Red Roof Inn. Having learned my lesson from sectionals of buying shady energy drinks, I bought a pack of Monster Energy to keep me up on the long drive across the state. It took us twenty minutes just to leave Oakland due to the mass exodus of undergraduates moving out, but it was smooth sailing once I dropped off my food at home and said bye to mum and dad and cat. It was also prom night for my high school and all those memories came flooding back. Just kidding, you should know by now I have no prom memories.

The miles slowly tick away and we stop for dinner at Popeye's on a turnpike rest stop. There, we saw members of Pitt A, Lehigh women, and Xavier frisbee teams. What a party. The chicken felt a little undercooked, but I just wanted to fill my stomach. We get back on the road and tried to find a radio station that was broadcasting the second day of the NFL draft but were unable to. Avoiding a speeding ticket, we arrive at the house around 10:30PM and make ourselves comfortable. It was a big weekend for us.

### Regionals

So Pitt B plays in the Ohio Valley region. Sixteen teams from the region qualify to battle for one bid to go to Nationals. The teams are divided into four pools of four and the top three teams from each pool make bracket play while the teams that lose out are relegated to the thirteenth place bracket. The seedings and pools work out as the following:

Pool A: #1, #8, #12, #13

Pool B: #2, #7, #11, #14

Pool C: #3, #6, #10, #15

Pool D: #4, #5, #9, #16

In a twist of fate, we ended up as #13 and have to face who else but #1 Pitt A as well as #8 Lehigh and #12 West Chester. Everybody loves a good underdog story right?

The fields in Allentown are another hour away from Havertown so we got up bright and early to make our first game at 9AM against Lehigh. Running a small roster of eighteen and missing seniors who were busy graduating, we got roasted 5-15. Our next game was against Pitt A. Want to guess how that went? At least we scored unlike poor IUP two weeks ago at sectionals. Lastly, we played West Chester. We managed to beat them last year, but this year's version of the team proved too much for us as we put up a good fight, but lost 9-14. Keep those teams in mind for later.

I would get into details about the actual games, but there was nothing impressive. Our opponents were objectively more skilled and athletic and we simply could not keep up. In the end, there is nothing much you can do about that. We raised our eyebrows when #11 Akron proceeded to upset #2 and #7 to win its pool. That was interesting. Sure, one upset may have been a fluke, but two? Maybe we have a challenger for Pitt A's bid to Nationals. In any case, sure, we were disappointed by our results. That could have been us. Not upsetting Pitt A of course, but rather the other two teams in our pool. Unfortunately, we did not, but we have to look ahead. We still had a chance to hold seed. Our first match Sunday morning was against #16 Drexel. Let's roll.
